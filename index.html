  <h3 class="text-center"> Chicken</h3>
  <p>In random surveys of chicken products across the United States
  in 2012, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found
  48% of samples to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken
  farms, the chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on,
  and living in their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the
  bedding material (e.g. sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.).

During shipping from the concentrated animal feeding operation farm
 to the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates
 that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10
 rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment,
 the chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit
 inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the
 chickens, or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels
 of the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most
 chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces.

There is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process
 removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed.
 [29] The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed
 to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed
 processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds
 going down the processing line, and the equipment on the line itself. At
 one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths
 (e.g. bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off 
 or kill this bacterial contamination. Unfortunately, the fecal contamination,
 once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin
 and muscle, is impossible to completely remove.

With slaughter lines processing up to 140 birds/minute, safety inspectors
 do not have adequate time to properly examine visible fecal matter.[30]
 The USDA is currently allowing some abattoirs to process at unlimited
 line speeds (i.e. in excess of 140 birds/minute), further exacerbating 
 the fecal contamination issue.

  <h3 class="text-center"> Meat</h3>
  <p>Fresh meat can be cooked for immediate consumption, or be processed, that is, treated for longer-term preservation and later consumption, possibly after further preparation. Fresh meat cuts or processed cuts may produce iridescence, commonly thought to be due to spoilage but actually caused by structural coloration and diffraction of the light.[78] A common additive to processed meats for both preservation and the prevention of discoloration is sodium nitrite. This substance is a source of health concerns because it may form carcinogenic nitrosamines when heated.[79]

Meat is prepared in many ways, as steaks, in stews, fondue, or as dried meat like beef jerky. It may be ground then formed into patties (as hamburgers or croquettes), loaves, or sausages, or used in loose form (as in "sloppy joe" or Bolognese sauce).

Some meat is cured by smoking, which is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to the smoke from burning or smoldering plant materials, most often wood. In Europe, alder is the traditional smoking wood, but oak is more often used now, and beech to a lesser extent. In North America, hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, alder, maple, and fruit-tree woods are commonly used for smoking. Meat can also be cured by pickling, preserving in salt or brine (see salted meat and other curing methods). Other kinds of meat are marinated and barbecued, or simply boiled, roasted, or fried.

Meat is generally eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw beef, veal or fish (tartare). Steak tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced raw beef or horse meat.[80][81] Meat is often spiced or seasoned, particularly with meat products such as sausages. Meat dishes are usually described by their source (animal and part of body) and method of preparation (e.g., a beef rib).

Meat is a typical base for making sandwiches. Popular varieties of sandwich meat include ham, pork, salami and other sausages, and beef, such as steak, roast beef, corned beef, pepperoni, and pastrami. Meat can also be molded or pressed (common for products that include offal, such as haggis and scrapple) and canned.

  <h3 class="text-center"> Sushi</h3>
  <p>Makizushi (巻き寿司, "rolled sushi"), norimaki (海苔巻き, "Nori roll") or makimono (巻物, "variety of rolls") is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a makisu (巻き簾). Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. Makizushi is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of makizushi, but many other kinds exist.

Futomaki (太巻, "thick, large or fat rolls") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with nori on the outside.[20] A typical futomaki is five to six centimetres (2 to 2 1⁄2 in) in diameter.[21] They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called ehō-maki (恵方巻, lit. happy direction rolls).[22] By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan.[23] Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, kampyō gourd, takenoko bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of tamagoyaki omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and oboro (food) whitefish flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings.[20] Traditionally, the vinegared rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sugar. Popular protein ingredients are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, eggs, tunas, or shrimps. Vegetables usually include cucumbers, lettuces, and takuan (沢庵) (pickled radish).

Short grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice. Nowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice and cereals etc. Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating. Tamago makizushi (玉子巻き寿司) is makizushi is rolled out by a thin egg. Tempura Makizushi (天ぷら 巻き寿司) or Agezushi (揚げ寿司ロール) is a fried version of the dish.

Hosomaki (細巻, "thin rolls") is a small cylindrical piece, with nori on the outside. A typical hosomaki has a diameter of about 2.5 centimetres (1 in).[21] They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, kanpyō, nattō, umeboshi paste, squid with shiso (Japanese herb). Kappamaki, (河童巻) a kind of Hosomaki filled with cucumber, is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, kappamaki is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods.

Tekkamaki (鉄火巻) is a kind of hosomaki filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word tekka, meaning "red hot iron", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called tekkaba (鉄火場), much like the sandwich.[24][25] Negitoromaki (ねぎとろ巻) is a kind of hosomaki filled with scallion (negi) and chopped tuna (toro). Fatty tuna is often used in this style. Tsunamayomaki (ツナマヨ巻) is a kind of hosomaki filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise.

Ehōmaki (恵方巻, "lucky direction roll") is a roll composed of seven ingredients considered to be lucky. Ehōmaki are often eaten on setsubun in Japan. The typical ingredients include kanpyō, egg, eel, and shiitake mushrooms. Ehōmaki often include other ingredients too. People usually eat the ehōmaki while facing the direction considered to be auspicious that year.[26]

Temaki (手巻, "hand roll") is a large cone-shaped piece of nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical temaki is about 10 centimetres (4 in) long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, temaki must be eaten quickly after being made because the nori cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the nori in pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating.[27]
